# Deen Haque

Welcome to my personal website!

This site's boilerplate was set up using the 🐐 `create-react-app`, it was built using `ReactJS` and styled with frustration and `Styled Components` (mostly the former).

The site should let you learn more about me. It was a fun way to let me learn a bit more about `Styled Components` and deploying a website.

Hopefully you like the website!
